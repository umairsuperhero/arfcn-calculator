WiFrost gNB Configuration Tool
The WiFrost gNB Configuration Tool is a web-based application designed to simplify the configuration of 5G Macro gNodeB (gNB) settings. It provides a user-friendly interface for calculating key parameters such as ARFCN (Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number) and GSCN (Global Synchronization Channel Number) based on inputs like frequency band, bandwidth, and center frequency. Whether you’re optimizing for coverage or capacity, this tool ensures accurate results with minimal effort—ideal for both beginners and experienced users in 5G networks.

Features
Intuitive Inputs: Easily select frequency band, bandwidth, center frequency, and optimization goal (coverage or capacity) using dropdowns and text fields.
Automated Calculations: Instantly generate ARFCN, channel range, and GSCN options with real-time validation.
User Guidance: Tooltips and dynamic text explain each parameter and guide your selections.
Visual Aid: A frequency axis diagram makes outputs easy to interpret.
Responsive Design: Optimized for embedding in Notion or viewing on any device.
Usage Instructions
Select Frequency Band: Choose from supported bands (e.g., n38, n41, n77, n78, B48).
Choose Bandwidth: Select a bandwidth from 10 MHz to 100 MHz in 10 MHz increments.
Enter Center Frequency: Input the desired center frequency in MHz.
Set Optimization Goal: Pick "Coverage" or "Capacity" to filter GSCN options.
Calculate: Click the "Calculate" button to view ARFCN, channel range, and GSCN dropdown.
Select GSCN: Choose a GSCN from the dropdown and review the validation feedback.
